# HAGIWO-040-VCS-Eurorack
Through-hole PCB version of the [HAGIWO 040 "Select" Voltage controlled Switch Eurorack module](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYyemBHd6mM&t=15s).

I made the change to switch the IC to a DG211/DG411, since those are far more available to me.

You can find the schematic and BOM in the root folder. 
For the PCBs, the module has one circuit PCB and one panel PCB. You can order them on any common PCB manufacturing service, I used JLCPCB. Standard settings should be fine.

Probably the only part that is a bit special about the BOM in this are the switches: I made the choice to switch the standard push switches HAGIWO uses to CHERRY MX switches.
They are bigger, sure, but they are also far more satisfying and everyone can [insert their favourite type](https://switchandclick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cherry-MX-Switch-Guide-1-1024x679.webp).
